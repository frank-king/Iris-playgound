# Exercises of *Lecture Notes on Iris*

This playground is where I do exercises in 
[Lecture Notes on Iris: Higher-Order Concurrent Separation
Logic](https://iris-project.org/tutorial-pdfs/iris-lecture-notes.pdf)
to learn [Iris](https://iris-project.org/).

The [`tex`](tex/) directory contains part of the exercises written in LaTeX.
